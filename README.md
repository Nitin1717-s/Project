MAX 30100 sensor

OLED display (SSD 1306)

Bluetooth HC 05

Connecting wires

## WORKING

This project is built upon three foundational principles: sensor technology, data processing, and wireless communication. At its core, the MAX30100 sensor captures biometric data when a user places their finger on it, measuring vital signs such as blood oxygen levels and heart rate. This data is then transmitted to a microcontroller, which serves as the central processing unit. The microcontroller processes the raw data, performing necessary calculations and preparing it for transmission. Using a Bluetooth HC-05 module, the processed information is wirelessly sent to a connected mobile device. On the mobile app, sophisticated algorithms analyze the received data, generating precise readings of the user’s health metrics. These calculated values are then displayed in real-time on an OLED display module, providing users with immediate feedback. This integration of sensor technology with advanced data processing and wireless communication ensures that health monitoring is both accurate and user-friendly. The system’s ability to deliver timely and precise health information supports users in making informed decisions about their well-being, enhancing overall health management.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the Smart Blood Oxygen Level and Heart Rate Monitoring System marks a significant leap forward in health technology. It combines advanced sensor technology, efficient data processing, and reliable wireless communication to provide an easy-to-use tool for tracking health in real-time. The MAX30100 sensor accurately measures key health metrics like blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The microcontroller processes this data, and the Bluetooth HC-05 module sends it to a mobile device, where a mobile app analyzes it. This analysis, along with real-time updates on an OLED display, offers users clear insights into their health. This system not only improves monitoring accuracy but also empowers users to take charge of their health proactively, making it an essential tool for better health management.
